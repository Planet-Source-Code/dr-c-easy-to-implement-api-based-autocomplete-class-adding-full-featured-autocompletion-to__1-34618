### More Info
 
Simply define a class and link it to the target combo box.

The demo project should be self explanatory, but basically all you have to do is add the class to your project and upon the Load event of your form, simply initialize a class instance for each of your combo box controls. The AutoDropdown property can easily be set in code. In the example project I tied it to a check box. Play around with it to see how it works.

Simply the functionality of AutoCompletion.
